NOTES:

1. IT IS POSSIBLE TO COMBINE BUT RUN SCRIPTS, HOWEVER, I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING SO AS TRAINING TAKES A LONG TIME, ESPECIALLY FOR 
   COMPLEX MODELS. THE USER HAS TO FIGURE OUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MODEL BASED ON THE DESIRED OUTPUTS. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN
   BY THE CREATORS OF THE ALLEGRO MLIP IN THEIR OWN CONFIGS.YAML FILE - https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/blob/main/configs/full.yaml

2. FOR TRAINING, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING MORE CPU CORES, THIS IS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA PARSING PARALLELIZATION 
   FROM 0.5.5 ONWARDS. REFER TO THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION - https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/discussions/182
   FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS. ALTERNATIVELY, ONE CAN ALSO REFER TO THE DOCUMENTATION OF 0.5.5 TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UPDATE.

3. IF YOU INTEND TO HAVE SOME TEST SETS, PLEASE ENSURE THAT IN YOUR INPUT.YAML FILE, THE SUM OF YOUR TRAINING + VALIDATION DATASETS
   DO NOT ADD UP TO 100%, YOU NEED TO LEAVE SOME FOR TESTING. TESTING IS DONE BY THE NEQUIP-EVALUATE COMMAND.

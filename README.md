THE SCRIPTS ATTACHED IN THIS REPOSITORY ALLOWS ONE TO INSTALL THE MLIPS AND RUN THE MLIPS. THESE SCRIPTS WORK BY DEFAULT.
HOWEVER, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE USER LOOKS THROUGH SOME OF THE PARAMETERS CAREFULLY AND DECIDES IF ALTERATIONS ARE NECESSARY, I.E., NO. OF GPUS/CPUS USED, INPUT HYPERPARAMETERS, ETC.

1. THE USERS OF THESE SCRIPTS SHOULD HAVE SOFTWARE AND SIMULATION FOLDERS (THE LAYOUT OF EACH OF THESE FOLDERS WILL BE FURTHER ELABORATED UPON IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SECTIONS)
   IN THEIR HOME/SCRATCH DIRECTORY:
   
```
	 $HOME/
	 ├── software
	 └── simulation
	 $SCRATCH/
	 ├── software
	 └── simulation
```
  

2. IN MY INSTALLATION SCRIPTS, I HAVE CHOSEN THE SCRATCH DIRECTORY FOR ALL INSTALLATIONS DUE TO THE SIZE CONSTRAINTS. IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ADJUST THE SCRIPTS TO HAVE THE DIFFERENT LAMMPS 
   BUILDS CONTAINED IN THE SAME SOURCE DIRECTORY (NOT INCLUDING DEEPMD). MOREOVER, ONE CAN EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING ALLEGRO TO RUN NEQUIP, THIS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE SINCE ALLEGRO IS SIMPLY 
   AN EXTENSION OF NEQUIP AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO SIMPLY BY USING THE NEQUIP BUILDERS IN YOUR INPUT.YAML SCRIPT INSTEAD. ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS, ONE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT 
   SPACE IN $HOME.
